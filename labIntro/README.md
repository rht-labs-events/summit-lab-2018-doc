:green_book: HAProxy is running on the *workstation* machine.  This provides the option to do port forwarding for access to the web console and other services running on the OpenShift Container Platform (this is *one way* to work around DNS and routing limitations in the underlying Ravello environment). Ports included are 80, 8443 and 8080-8085.

#### Architecture

[![alt text](img/diagram.png)](https://rht-labs-events.github.io/summit-lab-2018-doc/labIntro/img/diagram.png)

* You can ssh as `root` from the bastion to any of the OpenShift Container Platform cluster nodes.

* When using ssh to access the lab with the user `lab-user`, it is possible to `*sudo* -i` to get `root` access.

* The environment contains a few useful applications which will help you in knowing your cluster state.

#### Prometheus

Prometheus will obtain information from endpoints across the environment, and raises alerts based on a set of rules. These alerts are passed to Alertmanager for distribution to dashboards, etc.

#### Alertmanager

Alertmanager is used to aggregate alerts and dispatch them to the required delivery destination.

#### Grafana

Grafana is used to graphically represent cluster data. It interacts directly with Prometheus as its data source.

 [![alt text](img/grafana.png)](https://rht-labs-events.github.io/summit-lab-2018-doc/labIntro/img/grafana.png)

Grafana is pre-built with useful dashboards to assist you during the course of this lab. Although not every one of them is needed to finish the lab scenarios, it is highly recommended that you have a closer look at all of them.

The first time you logon to Grafana, you will see a "Home" tab in the top-left corner.

[![alt text](img/grafana-home.png)](https://rht-labs-events.github.io/summit-lab-2018-doc/labIntro/img/grafana-home.png)

If you click on the "Home" tab, a drop-down list with every available dashboard should appear.

[![alt text](img/grafana-dashboards.png)](https://rht-labs-events.github.io/summit-lab-2018-doc/labIntro/img/grafana-dashboards.png)

Below are the 3 Grafana dashboards strictly necessary to finish this lab.

**Labs Generic**

It contains generic information about the cluster such us pod count per node, DNS errors or nodes down.

**ETCD**

`etcd` cluster related information.

**Builds Overview**

Builds related information.

#### Jenkis/Jenkins Monitor

Jenkins and its `Build Monitor Plugin` is deployed as part of the Lab. This tool is not required to solve any scenario during the Lab session but is used to fire up Builds and Deployments automatically during the session. `Build Monitor Plugin` is an useful tool to radiate information to DevOps teams and get a quick feedback from Builds and Deployments after any new committed code to our applications.

The view we have pre-configured for this Lab is showing the actual status for our demo app which is built and deployed to different environments (dev, test, uat) in the OpenShift Cluster.

### Getting Started

Open a new web browser window (or tab), then enter the URL below. Use the credentials provided during the lab session:

* *OpenShift console:* `https://console-<YOUR-GUID>.<TYPE>.opentlc.com`

:heavy_check_mark: TIP: `<TYPE>` refers to the environment that is being deployed. If deployed from RHPDS, use `rhpds`, otherwise, use `generic`

:heavy_check_mark: TIP: You can also find these URLs in the email you received when you provisioned the demo environment.


### Review the Environment

Once the OpenShift environment is up and running, log in to the *OpenShift Container Platform Web Console* at `https://console-<YOUR-GUID>.<TYPE>.opentlc.com/console`.

:heavy_check_mark: TIP: `<TYPE>` refers to the environment that is being deployed. If deployed from RHPDS, use `rhpds`, otherwise, use `generic`

:heavy_check_mark: TIP: In order to log into the console, use the credentials provided in the lab slides.

:clock10: If nothing is running in the OpenShift Container Platform cluster yet, give it some more time. There is a background service running, which is populating the cluster with content.

### Lab Launcher

The lab is being launched using the command `lab`. This command can only be used from the bastion host.

Example:
```
> lab -l
INFO[0000] Starting Wrapper                             
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Scenario 0
Description: Observe ETCD state and recover when quorum is lost. Simulate 2 DC deployment.
Actions: [init, solve, break1, break2]
To init this scenario execute:
  > lab -s 0 -a init

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Scenario 1
Description: Observe ETCD - Bonus task
Actions: [init, solve]
To init this scenario execute:
  > lab -s 1 -a init
...
```

### CLI access

Once the environment has been successfully bootstrapped, you should see all the welcome screen urls **replaced with valid values** (note that `example.com` is not the valid domain for your Lab):

:heavy_check_mark: NOTE: **This information can be recalled at any point by executing: `lab -h`**

```

    https://prometheus.apps.example.com
    https://grafana.apps.example.com
    https://alertmanager.apps.example.com
```

Initially, there is a set of pre-deployed applications available for your use. Please take a moment to become familiar with what is already there.

Core tools used in this labs are supported by Red Hat. In addition, there are a few non-core ones which are supported by OpenSource communities.

Today's Lab contains a number scenarios. They are all independent, but it is not recommended to jump from one scenario to the next without finishing the previous ones first.

### Info about the scenarios

Every scenario has the following parts:

* `Introduction`: Documentation and explanation of the scenario.
* `Tasks`: Tasks to be performed during the scenario.
* `Solution`: Explanation of the actions that need to be taken to solve the scenario.
* `Appendix`: Materials for further reading.
